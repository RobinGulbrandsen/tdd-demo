# CODE QUALITY
==========================

## How to write good code
- Small defined functions and objects that does ONE thing

## Introduce the "game" - TDD in action
- Define a function and what its suppose to do
- P1 types in a test, it breaks
- P2 writes code to solve the test
- P2 writes a new test within the scope that breaks
- P1 writes code that solves the test
- P1 writes a new test

The player that can't come up with a new test, or can't resolve the test, loses.

It's a smart thing when doing this, to write as little code as possible, so you'll be able to break it after with a test. And write spesific tests, so you'll be able to come up with something new later on.

By default, we'll end up with GREAT, code!
